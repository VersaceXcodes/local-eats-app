You are improving ONLY the UX/UI of an existing mobile app called “Local Eats.”
Do NOT write code. Do NOT propose backend or new feature development.
Keep all current functionality and data. Deliver design artifacts only.

OBJECTIVE
- Make the experience clearer, faster, and more visually desirable to drive repeat orders.
- Reduce cognitive load, taps, and indecision; highlight food and time-sensitive offers.

DELIVERABLES (Design, not code)
- Updated information architecture map and user flows.
- Pixel-perfect screen comps (iOS + Android key sizes) for: Onboarding, Home, Search/Filters,
  Restaurant List, Restaurant Detail, Item Detail/Modifiers, Cart, Checkout, Order Tracking,
  Offers/Promos, Account.
- Component library (buttons, chips, tabs, cards, banners, modals/sheets, toasts).
- Design tokens (colors, type scale, spacing, radii, shadows) + accessibility notes.
- Clickable prototype with annotations explaining decisions and motion specs.

GLOBAL PRINCIPLES
- Familiar patterns > novelty. Target ≤3 taps to add, ≤60s to reorder.
- Thumb-reachable CTAs; 8-pt spacing; consistent corner radii (12–16).
- WCAG AA contrast; touch targets ≥44×44; dynamic type friendly.

NAVIGATION & IA
- Use a persistent bottom bar (max 5): Home, Search, Orders, Offers, Account.
- Keep “Cart” as a sticky preview pill (items + total) across browse surfaces.
- Surface shortcuts on Home: “Your usual,” “Recent,” “Popular near you,” “Deals.”
- Make Search globally accessible; show active filters as removable chips.

SEARCH, FILTERS, SORT
- Chips for Cuisine, Dietary (e.g., Vegan/Halal/GF), Price, Under 30 min, Top Rated.
- Default sort = Personalized/Relevance; alternatives: Delivery time, Rating, Price.
- Empty states give helpful next actions (e.g., widen radius, switch to pickup).

LIST & CARD PATTERNS
- Restaurant card: photo, name, rating, delivery time/fee, distance, price level, promo badge.
- Menu card: image, title, short descriptor, dietary tags, price, “+” quick add.
- Consistent image aspect ratios (e.g., 4:3 list cards, 1:1 thumbnails); graceful fallbacks.

ITEM DETAIL & MODIFIERS
- Large image gallery above the fold; key facts (price, dietary, calories) left-aligned.
- Group modifiers; show price deltas inline; sensible defaults preselected.
- Primary CTA: “Add to cart” sticky; post-add lightweight upsell sheet (sides/drinks).

CART & CHECKOUT (UI only)
- Step indicator: Address → Time → Payment → Review (transparent fees, ETA).
- Pre-filled known data; clear error copy; promo entry visible but not dominant.

OFFERS & LOYALTY (visuals only)
- Dedicated “Offers” tab + inline badges; consistent promo tiles with clear terms.
- Simple progress visuals (points, next reward ring, streak indicator).

VISUAL STYLE
- Modern, minimal, generous whitespace. Emphasize appetizing food photography.
- Palette: quiet neutrals + one energetic accent for CTAs/states; support dark mode.
- Typography: clean sans; 14–18 body, 20–24 headings; tight vertical rhythm.

IMAGERY
- Prioritize real, high-quality dish photos; avoid stock that misrepresents items.
- Show variety and freshness; avoid cluttered props. Consistent lighting and color.

MOTION & FEEDBACK (spec only; no implementation)
- 150–250ms micro-interactions: add-to-cart confirm, filter apply, progress updates.
- Non-blocking transitions; subtle haptics (platform-appropriate) in specs.

ACCESSIBILITY & INTERNATIONALIZATION
- Don’t rely on color alone for status; provide icons/labels.
- Localizable strings; accommodate long names and right-to-left mirroring in layouts.

CONTENT & MICROCOPY
- Clear, friendly, concise. Examples:
  - Empty cart: “Your cart is hungry. Add something tasty.”
  - Deal badge: “20% off · Today only”
  - Error: “Payment failed. Try another method or use cash at delivery.”

QUALITY BAR / ACCEPTANCE CHECK
- Primary CTA visible and reachable on all key screens.
- Reorder possible in ≤3 taps from Home.
- Fees, ETA, and deal terms unambiguous and readable.
- Image quality consistent; aspect ratios enforced.
- All components meet contrast/tap-target guidelines.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.
